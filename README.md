# R-scripts
Collection of R scripts I used during my masters thesis

This repository will contain all the R scripts I am using for my masters thesis in the 
field of evolutionary biology.

The main aspects will there be morphometric differentiation,
qst-fst comparisons and therefore variance components and f statistics as well as a lot of 
ways to graphically show results for the previously mentioned topics.
